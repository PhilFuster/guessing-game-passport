                Pug was formerly known as "jade". However, it was revealed to the
                maintainers that "jade" is a registered trademark; as a result, they had to
                change their name.

                Maintainers acquired permission to occupy the package name, but future
                releases will be under the name "pug".

                Because Less looks just like CSS, learning is a breeze. Less only makes a
                few convenient additions to the CSS language, which is one of th reasons it
                can be learned so quickly.
